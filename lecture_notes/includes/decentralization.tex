\chapter{Decentralization of blockchain system}\label{chap:decentralization}
Decentralization represents th efairness of the distribution of the accouunting right of the nodes in thee blockchain network. The consensus protocol must be designed so that the decision power does not eventually concentrate on a few nodes.\\

\noindent \cref{sec:decentralization_pos} focuses on the \PoS protocol by modelling the evolution of the stakes of the nodes by a stochastic process with reinforcement. \cref{sec:decentralization_pow} presents the concept of mining pool and discusses the threat they represent for the decentralized aspect of the network.
