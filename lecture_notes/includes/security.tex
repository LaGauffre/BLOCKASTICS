\chapter{Security of blockchain systems}\label{chap:security}
The security evaluation of blockchain systems consists in calculating the probability of a successful attack on the blockchain. We will focus, in \cref{sec:double_spending}, on the double spending attack which is concern for \PoW powererd cryptocurrency like teh bitcoin one. Security is also at risk when the node have an incentive to deviate from the prescribed protocol. \cref{sec:blockwithholding} discusses the opportunity for miner of \PoW equipped blockchain to resort to blockwithholding strategy to optimize their revenue. 

\section{Double-spending in PoW}\label{sec:double_spending}
A double spending attack aims at generating a concurrent blockchain to replace the main one. Consider the following scenario
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Marie sends to John BTC$10$
	\item The transaction from Marie to John is recorded in the blockchain
	\item John is advised for $\alpha$ confirmation, that is for $k-1$ block to be appended after the block where the Marie to John transaction is recorded
	\item Once $\alpha$ confirmations have been sent, John ships the good
	\item Meanwhile, Marie has started working on her own blockchain version where the Marie to John transaction is replaced by a Marie to Marie transaction
	\item At the shipment date the main blockchain is ahead by $z$ blocks 
	\item Marie's goal is then to work on her blockchain branch to catch up with the main branch. If she manages to to that then her branch will replace the public branch and she recovers her bitcoin. She can therefore spend these bitcoins again hence the name double spending.
\end{enumerate}
The race between the two competing branches of the blockchain is summarized on \cref{fig:dp_illustration}.

\subsection{Random walk model}\label{ssec:double_spending_rw}
We define a discrete time stochastic process $(R_n)_{n\geq0}$ equal to the difference in length between the public and the private branch of the blockchain. At each time step a block is found, it belongs to the main branch with probability $p$ to the other branch with probability $q=1-p$. The parameter $p$ represents the proportion of hashpower owned by the honest miners, while $q$ is that of the attacker. We have
$$
R_0 = z\text{, and  }R_n = z+Y_1+\ldots+ Y_n.
$$
The $Y_i$'s are \iid random variables such that 
$$
\mathbb{P}(Y=1) = p\in (0,1)\text{, and }\mathbb{P}(Y=-1) = 1-p=q,
$$ 
$(R_n)_{n\geq0}$ is therefore a random walk on $\mathbb{Z}$. We assume that $p>q$ so that the attacker does not hold more than half of the total hashpower. Define the double spending time as 
$$
{\tau_0} = \inf\{n>0\text{ ; }R_n = 0\}.
$$
Our goal is to study the distribution of this stopping time with respect to the filtration 
$$
\mathcal{F}_n = \sigma(Y_1,\ldots, Y_n),\text{ }n\geq1.
$$ 
An illustration of this first-hitting time problem is provided in \cref{fig:double_spending_time}.

\caption{Illustration of the first-hitting time problem of a double spending attack.}
\label{fig:double_spending_time}
\end{figure}
Let us denote by 
$$
\mathbb{P}_z(\cdot) = \mathbb{P}(\cdot|R_0 = z)\text{ and }\mathbb{E}_z(\cdot) = \mathbb{E}(\cdot|R_0 = z) 
$$
We are interested for now in the cvonditional distribution of ${\tau_0}$ provided that $R_0 = z$.
\subsubsection{Double spending probability}\label{sssec:double_spending_rw_dsp}
The double spending probability is defined as 
$$
\phi(z)=\mathbb{P}_z({\tau_0} <\infty),
$$
and given in the following result
\begin{theo}
If $p>q$ then 
$$
\phi(z) = \left(\frac{q}{p}\right)^z.
$$
\end{theo}
\noindent We give two proofs for this result, the first one uses simple first step analysis exploiting the Markov property of the random walk. The second one uses Martingale and the optional stopping theorem.\\

\underline{\textit Proof 1:}\\
Using a first step analysis, we have 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:difference_equation}
\phi(z) = p\phi(z+1)+(1-p)\phi(z-1),\text{ }z\geq1.
\end{equation}
We also have the boundary conditions
\begin{equation}\label{eq:boundary_conditions_double_spending}
\phi(0) = 1\text{ and }\underset{z\rightarrow +\infty}{\lim}\phi(z) = 0
\end{equation}
Equation \eqref{eq:difference_equation} is a linear difference equation of order $2$ associated to the following characteristic equation
$$
px^2 - x + 1-p = 0
$$
which has two roots on the real line with 
$$
r_1 = 1, \text{ and }r_2 = \frac{1-p}{p}.
$$
The solution of \eqref{eq:difference_equation} is given by 
$$
\phi(z)=A+B\left(\frac{1-p}{p}\right)^z,
$$
where $A$ and $B$ are constant. Using the boudary conditions \eqref{eq:boundary_conditions_double_spending}, we deduce that
$$
\phi(z) = \left(\frac{1-p}{p}\right)^z
$$
as announced.\\
For the second proof we need the notion of martingale
\begin{definition}
A stochastic process $(X_n)_{n\geq0}$, is called a martingale with respect to a filtration $\mathcal{F}_n$, if
\begin{itemize}
  \item[(i)] $X_n$ is $\mathcal{F}_n$-adapted
  \item[(ii)] $\mathbb{E}(X_n)<\infty\text{ for }n\geq\geq0$ 
  \item[(iii)] $\mathbb{E}(X_n|\mathcal{F}_{n-1}) = X_{n-1}$
\end{itemize} 
\end{definition}
\noindent and the optional stopping theorem.
\begin{theo}
Let $T$ be a stopping time for the Martingale $(X_n)_{n\geq0}$ then it holds that 
$$
\mathbb{E}(X_T) = \mathbb{E}(X_0) 
$$
in each of the following situations
\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] $T$ is bounded almost surely 
\item[(ii)] There exists $c>0$ such that $|X_{T\land n}|<c$ for every $n>0$.
\item[(iii)] $\mathbb{E}(T)<\infty$, and, for some $K>0$ we have that 
$$
|X_n(\omega) - X_{n-1}(\omega)|\leq K,\text{ }\forall (n,\omega).
$$
\end{itemize}

\end{theo}
\underline{\textit Proof 2:}\\
Define the process 
$$
X_n = \exp\left[sR_n- n\kappa_Y(s)\right],
$$
where $s>0$, and 
$$
\kappa_Y(s) = \log\left[\mathbb{E}\left(e^{sY}\right)\right],
$$
is the cumulant generating function of $Y$. 
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:wald_martingale_RW}
$(X_n)_{n\geq0}$ is a $\mathcal{F}_n$-martingale.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Denote by $M_Y(s) = \mathbb{E}(e^{sY})$ the moment generating function of $Y$, we have that 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathbb{E}(X_n|\mathcal{F}_n)&=&\mathbb{E}\left\{\exp\left[sR_n - n\kappa_Y(s)\right]|\mathcal{F}_n\right\}\\
&=&\exp\left[sR_{n-1} - n\kappa_Y(s)\right]\mathbb{E}\left[\exp\left(sY_{n}\right)|\mathcal{F}_n\right]\\
&=&\exp\left[sR_{n-1} \right]M_Y(s)^{-n} M_Y(s)\\
&=& X_{n-1}.
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{proof} 
The equation $\kappa_Y(s) = 0$ is equivalent to 
$$
pe^s+qe^{-s} = 1
$$
which admits $\gamma =\log(q/p)$ as only nonnegative solution. The process $(\e^{\gamma R_n})_{n\geq0}$ is a $\mathcal{F}_n$-Martingale. Define $\tau_a = \inf\{n\geq 0\text{ ; }R_n = a\}$, for $a>z$. Consider the stopping time $\tau = \tau_0\land\tau_a$, we have that for any $n>0$, 
$$
\mathbb{P}( \tau=\infty) \leq \mathbb{P}( \tau > n) < \mathbb{P}( |R_n| \leq a) = 0;
$$
We can therefore apply the optional stopping time theorem at $\tau$ to get
\begin{eqnarray*}
 \mathbb{E}(X_{\tau}) = \mathbb{E}(X_{0})&\Leftrightarrow& \mathbb{P}(\tau = \tau_0) + [1- \mathbb{P}(\tau = \tau_0)]\e^{a z}= \e^{\gamma z}\\
 &\Leftrightarrow& \mathbb{P}(\tau = \tau_0)] = \frac{\e^{\gamma z}-\e^{a z}}{1-\e^{az}}.
\end{eqnarray*}
We then let $a\rightarrow\infty$ in the above equation to conclude that 
$$
\mathbb{P}(\tau = \tau_0) =\left(\frac{q}{p}\right)^z.
$$
\begin{exercise}
What happens if
\begin{itemize}
\item $p = q = 1/2$? 
\item $q>p$?
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}
In practice the number of blocks $z$ is actually random variable 
$$
Z = (\alpha -M)_+,
$$ 
where $M$ corresponds to the number of blocks the attacker managed to mine while the vendor waits for $\alpha$ confirmations. If we assume that a block mined by the honest miners is a success while a block mined by the attacker is a failure then $M$ actually counts the number of failure before $\alpha$ successes. We have that $M\sim \text{Neg-Bin}(\alpha, p)$ where $M$ has a probability mass function (\pmf) given by 
$$
\mathbb{P}(M = m) = \binom{\alpha+m-1}{m}p^\alpha q^m.
$$
Whenever $Z = 0$ then double spending occur right away as $\phi(0) =1$. To derive the double spending probability, we condition upon the values of $Z$ via the law of total probability 
$$
\mathbb{P}( \text{Double Spending}) = \mathbb{P}(M\geq \alpha)+\sum_{m = 0}^{\alpha-1}\binom{\alpha+m-1}{m}q^\alpha p^m.
$$
\subsubsection{Double spending time}\label{sssec:double_spending_rw_dst}
In the block mining world time is money. Every hour spent in computing hashes is costly in terms of energy. It is then very interesting to know whether a double spending attack is meant to last long or not. Intuitively, we can think that if it must occur the it should at a earlier stage because as $p>1/2$ our random walk $(R_n)_{n\geq0}$ will eventually drift toward $+\infty$. The following result provides the probability distribution of $\tau_0$ when $R_0 = z$.
\begin{theo}
If $z = 0$ then $\tau_0=0$ almost surely. If $z>0$ then $\tau_0$ admits a \pmf given by 
$$
\mathbb{P}_z(\tau_0 = n)=
\frac{z}{n}\binom{n-z}{(n-z) / 2}p^{(n-z) / 2}q^{(n
+z) / 2}\text{ if }n>z\text{ and }n-z\text{ is even},
$$
and $0$ otherwise.
\end{theo}
\begin{proof}
We start by showing the following lemma, sometimes referred to as the Markov hitting time theorem.
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:markov_hitting_time}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:markov_hitting_time}
\mathbb{P}_z(\tau_0 = n) = \frac{z}{n}\mathbb{P}_z(R_n = 0)
\end{equation}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
If $z = 0$ then $\tau_0 = 0$ almost surely and both sides of \eqref{eq:markov_hitting_time} equal to $0$. Assume that $z\geq1$, we have that $\mathbb{P}_z(\tau_0 = n) = 0$ and $\mathbb{P}_z(R_n = 0) = 0$ whenever $n<z$ and $n-z$ is odd. The rest of the proof is by induction on $n\geq1$, when $n = 1$ we have that 
$$
\mathbb{P}_z(\tau_0 = 1) = 0 = \frac{z}{1}\mathbb{P}_z(R_1 = 0),\text{ for }z>1, 
$$
and 
$$\mathbb{P}_1(\tau_0 = 1) = q = \frac{1}{1}\mathbb{P}_1(R_1 = 0),\text{ for }z=1. 
$$
The property holds for $n=1$. Assume that it holds for some $n\geq1$. The law of total probability yields
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathbb{P}_z(\tau_0 = n+1)&=&\sum_{y\in\{-1,1\}}\mathbb{P}_z(\tau_0 = n+1|Y_1 = y)\mathbb{P}(Y_1 = y)\\
&=&\sum_{y\in\{-1,1\}}\mathbb{P}_{z+y}(\tau_0 = n)\mathbb{P}(Y_1 = y)\\
&=&\sum_{y\in\{-1,1\}}\frac{z+y}{n}\mathbb{P}_{z+y}(R_n = 0)\mathbb{P}(Y_1 = y)
\end{eqnarray*}
The second equality holds thanks to the strong Markov property. We further undo the law of total probability.
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathbb{P}_z(\tau_0 = n+1)&=&\sum_{y\in\{-1,1\}}\frac{z+y}{n}\mathbb{P}_{z}(Y_1 = y|R_{n+1} = 0)\mathbb{P}_z(R_{n+1} = 0)\nonumber\\
&=&\frac{\mathbb{P}_z(R_{n+1} = 0)}{n}\left[z+\mathbb{E}(Y_1|R_{n+1}=0)\right]\label{eq:law_total_probability_undone}
\end{eqnarray}
Since the $Y_i$ are \iid then it holds that 
$$
\mathbb{E}(Y_1|R_{n+1}=0) = \mathbb{E}(Y_i|R_{n+1}=0)\text{, } i = 1, \ldots, n+1,
$$
and it follows that 
$$
\mathbb{E}(Y_1|R_{n+1}=0) = \frac{1}{n+1}\sum_{i =1}^{n+1}\mathbb{E}(Y_i|R_{n+1}=0) = \frac{-z}{n+1}.
$$
Inserting the above expression in \eqref{eq:law_total_probability_undone} yields 
$$
\mathbb{P}_z(\tau_0 = n+1) = \frac{z}{n+1}\mathbb{P}_z(R_{n+1} = 0).
$$
\end{proof}
\begin{remark}
This proof is direct and simple but it is possible to make it shorter taking advantage of the ballot theorem. Indeed consider again the first hitting problem on \cref{fig:double_spending_time} and reverse the timeline. It corresponds to that of a random walk $(S_n)_{n\geq0}$ that starts at $0$, make upward jumps with probability $q$, and aims at reaching the level $z$ without crossing the $X$ axis, see \cref{fig:time_reversed_double_spending_time}.

Note that \cref{subfig:time_reversed_ds_RW_time} is the reflection of \cref{subfig:ds_RW_time} with respect to the $Y$ axis. We have equivalently
$$
\mathbb{P}_z(\tau_0) = \mathbb{P}(S_k>0,\text{ }1\leq k\leq n|S_n = z, S_0 = 0)\mathbb{P}_0(S_n = z|S_0=0),
$$
and 
$$
\mathbb{P}(S_k>0,\text{ }1\leq k\leq n|S_n = z, S_0 = 0) = \frac{z+(n-z)/2-(n-z)/2}{n} = \frac{z}{n}.
$$
\end{remark}
To complete the proof, we just note that 
$$
\mathbb{P}_z(R_n = 0) = \binom{n-z}{(n-z) / 2}p^{(n-z) / 2}q^{(n
+z) / 2}
$$
as it corresponds to a trajectory of $(R_n)_{n \geq0}$ starting at $R_0 = z$ ending at $0$ made of $(n-z)/2$ upward jumps and $(n+z)/2$ downward one.
\end{proof}
Just like in the previous section, the actual double spending time depends on the value of the random variable $Z = (\alpha -M)_+$.
