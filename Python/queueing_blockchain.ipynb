    "# Blockchain queue\n",
    "\n",
    "Blockchain efficiency is characterized by the throughput (how many transactions are confirmed per time unit) and latency (the average confirmation time of a transaction). These quantities of interest are study within the frame of a queueing model. The pending transactions arrive at a Poisson rate to form a queue, a fixed number $b$ (the first which entered the queue) will be processed in a block. The block generation time has distribution $G$ on $\\mathbb{R}_+$. The result is a $M/G^b/1$ queue. We are going to simulate trajectories of this process to study the average confirmation time and the number of pending transaction in the queue at stationarity. Let us assume that $G$ is exponential, which corresponds to the empirical data on the block arrival time in the bitcoin blockchain.\n",

    "Denote by $(S_i)$ the transaction arrival time and $(T_i)$ the blockarrival times."
